# Binary Templates
Binary template files for more easily interpreting things in a hex editor

Ones with a `.tcl` extension are made for the MacOS editor [Hex Fiend](http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/), though they should be a pretty good basis for anyone trying to make template files for other hex editors

`Unity5.#Sprite.tcl` files are templates for the modified Unity sprite files held in [`assets/files-5.*/SGCaret*_Sprite.dat`](../../assets)
